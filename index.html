    <h2>Maharashtrian Food</h2>
      <p>What comes to your mind when you think of Maharashtrian cuisine? A burst of flavours? A plate of steaming hot vada pav or pav bhaji? We bow down to the almost inexhaustible variety of street foods that the local kitchens of this mega state offer. From misal pav to aamti to bhelpuri, each one of them is a gem. Maharashtrian food is an exciting play of desi masalas, using some of the most basic food items and is all about local cooking styles. It is interesting to see that different regions within the state cook up their own exclusive versions of a standard dish. Vadas are regarded as a specialty of Mumbai as they are known to have originated there. If you happen to travel across the state, you will experience a significant change in flavours and prominence of local ingredients. The use of freshly ground masalas like malvani masala, goda masala and kala masala, is the highlight of Maharashtrian cuisine.Vegetables, lentils along with grains like wheat, rice, jowar and bajra constitute an integral part of everyday cooking. Breads are also given a lot of significance in a staple Maharashtrian diet and you have vadas, pavs, polis served in combination with bhajjis, missal, ussal or ragda.Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com
      The Kolhapur region is famous for its authentic white and red mutton curries as well as its traditional green chilly chutney. The Konkan belt cooks generously with coconut milk, cashew nuts, rice and mangoes. Kokum is another ingredient that is typical to most of the Maharashtrian preparations; it is widely used in place of tamarind. Aurangabad offers you a fusion between the quintessential Maharashtrian style cooking and Mughlai flavours.</p>
