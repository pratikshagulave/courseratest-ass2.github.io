    <h2>Maharashtrian Food</h2>
      <p>What comes to your mind when you think of Maharashtrian cuisine? A burst of flavours? A plate of steaming hot vada pav or pav bhaji? We bow down to the almost inexhaustible variety of street foods that the local kitchens of this mega state offer. From misal pav to aamti to bhelpuri, each one of them is a gem. Maharashtrian food is an exciting play of desi masalas, using some of the most basic food items and is all about local cooking styles. It is interesting to see that different regions within the state cook up their own exclusive versions of a standard dish. Vadas are regarded as a specialty of Mumbai as they are known to have originated there. If you happen to travel across the state, you will experience a significant change in flavours and prominence of local ingredients. The use of freshly ground masalas like malvani masala, goda masala and kala masala, is the highlight of Maharashtrian cuisine.Vegetables, lentils along with grains like wheat, rice, jowar and bajra constitute an integral part of everyday cooking. Breads are also given a lot of significance in a staple Maharashtrian diet and you have vadas, pavs, polis served in combination with bhajjis, missal, ussal or ragda.Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com

    <h2>Gujarati Food</h2>
      <p>Gujarati cuisine is one of the the oldest culinary treasures of India and is primarily vegetarian. It offers a wide variety of vegetarian dishes, each with its unique cooking style, different kinds of pickles, farsans, chutneys and foods that are always high on nutritional value. But the real essence of Gujarati food lies in the creative use of everyday vegetables and mild spices. It is an exquisite blend of flavors where sweet notes dominate most dishes like the famous Gujarati Kadhi., Dhokla and Fafda. Gujarat's coastal climate is mostly hot and dry which is why the use of sugar, tomatoes and lemon is quite common as these foods keep the body hydrated. Another distinctive characteristic of Gujarati food is its palate-pleasing combination of sweet and sour flavors.In big business houses, a traditional Gujarati meal sits on a lovely silver platter and comprises of an elaborate affair complete with rotis, dal/kadhi, sabzi or shaak, rice and homemade pickles to tickle your taste buds. 'Vaghaar' is a blend of spices purified in hot oil and generously drizzled over dal to enhance the flavor and impart an irresistible aroma. The prominence of ingredients like besan or gram flour, lentils, sesame seeds and yogurt is another feature that sets Gujarati dishes apart.
